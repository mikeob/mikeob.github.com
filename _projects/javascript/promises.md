description: "[TODO] An exploration of promises and how they affect performance!"

Haven't had a chance to do this yet, but what I'd like to do is explore the chrome performance tools with some artificial examples using some busy while loops or something. I've never used promises, so I'd like to both learn how they work as well as how they parallelize!
