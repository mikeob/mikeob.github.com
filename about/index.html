    <h3>Currently</h3>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm living in Brooklyn, NY and working as an Engineer at Facebook developing Live videos.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't have much of a background in front end work, so making this site is my idea of
      a forcing function to learn more!
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to write about what sort of stuff I'm learning, so this site will be some vague record
      of what's on my mind.

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a huge fan of all things musical.
      I've been learning the violin since April 2016 and try to attend live music whenever I can manage.

      Check out my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/michael.obeirne">Spotify</a> to see what I'm into.

    <h3>Outdoors</h3>
    <p>
      I'm pretty into just about anything that gets you outdoors. My big ones
      snowboarding, hiking, biking, and I'd like to start camping more.

    <h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
    <p>
      A huge hobby of mine used to be compeitive programming. I attended the 2014 ACM ICPC World Finals on behalf of Virginia Tech
      and was coached by a pretty cool guy named <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~gback/">Godmar Back</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since becoming a full time developer, I haven't had much energy to devote to this stuff, but I really hope
      to pick it up again someday.
