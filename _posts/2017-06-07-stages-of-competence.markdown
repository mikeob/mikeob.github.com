About 14 months ago, I started learning to play the violin. This was my first shot
at a tonal instrument, and man did I have no idea what I was getting into. Having
spent most of my life never humming, whistling, or honestly even singing (my first
karaoke experience was when I was 23), I was nearly tone deaf. I've always loved
music, but my brief drumming experience has always led me to focus on rhythm and time signatures.

It was pretty rough when I first started. I was hit bluntly in the face with the
harsh reality of an analog instrument. *Oh, that's what frets are for...*
My teacher was patient, but
I could tell sometimes she was fairly frustrated when I couldn't tell two notes
apart, or that I was out of tune. It was so hard to express that I didn't even
know what in tune was!

It wasn't until months later when I was in some mentorship training at work that
it all came into focus. The session was called "Situational Leadership" and talked
about the various types of leadership and when they should be applied. This was
framed by trying to classify where your mentee was in the "Four stages of Competence".

With most of us being 6+ years from our last psychology class, they took mercy and
broke those stages out for us.

You work your way up the pyramid, starting with Unconscious Incompetence (UI). *What
does it mean to be unconsciously incompetent?*, I thought. So clueless that you
don't even know that you're incompetent? Something was sounding familiar.

Depending on the stage that someone is in, they need different types of guidance.
Someone who is unconsciously incompetent needs data. They need examples of right,
wrong, and to learn for themselves what divides the two. In my case, I needed
a pure tone to compare myself to when I was out of tune to help hone the sense
of right and wrong.

This framing helped me understand my own deficiencies, but also gave me a little
more empathy for someone I'm mentoring who is stuck in the pits of UI. I'm still
pretty concretely sitting in-between conscious competence & incompetence, but I
think I've undone the wrong intuition.
