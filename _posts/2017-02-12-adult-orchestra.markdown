Today I went and attended an adult orchestra aimed at adults who were late starters
to whatever stringed instrument. I first was initiated by a small group of beginning
string players and we covered a few basic songs. I hung around afterward to observe
the larger orchestra play, but told no was not an option when I was asked to
join in.

Initially, I was completely terrified. They had a collection of about 6 full
pieces that they had all been working on for the past 5 weeks. Some were in key
signatures I haven't even learned the fingerings for. I took a sit by a soft-spoken
but incredibly friendly older woman. She joked with me about some of the harder
songs and mirrored my confusion about some of the other songs. We were both
non-stop smiles the whole time.

I couldn't get over how amazing it was to be a part of such a welcoming group
of people despite me being severely underqualified and potentially adding
dissonance to what may otherwise be a beautiful performance.  

They're not going to meet for a few weeks, but I'm pretty committed to be in a
better place once I return.

My first goal will be to learn all the various fingerings associated with the
different key signatures. For my own reference and perhaps your curiosity, I've
attached them below.
